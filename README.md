# Ly
A stack-based esoteric programming language.

## Usage
Download `ly.py` and run it like this:

```
ly.py myprogram.ly
```

There are also many optional flags, you can see all of them with this:
```
ly.py -h
```
Alternatively, you can use the [online interpreter](https://lylang.herokuapp.com/), although this version does not yet support debug flags.

For more information on the language, see the wiki.
